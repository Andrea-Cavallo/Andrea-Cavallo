## ABOUT ME

As a backend developer, I have written various functions, 
                debugged microservices, 
                and for each feature I have also written the corresponding jUnit test cases. 
                This approach of mine allows me to ensure the reliability and stability 
                of the code I write and the system as a whole. 
                I am highly skilled in using JUnit test framework, 
                and I am committed to writing comprehensive and robust 
                test cases that cover all the possible scenarios. 
                This not only guarantees the quality of the code but also helps 
                in maintaining it over time.


I have implemented orchestration logic using WS02 and Apache Camel,
                  specifically for mediating between microservices. 
                  This involved configuring routes and creating mediation flows 
                  using the WS02 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Apache Camel.
                  I have extensive experience in utilizing the features of these 
                  technologies to handle message routing, 
                  transformation, and protocol mediation.
                  I was able to implement these logic in a way that allows 
                  for seamless communication between microservices,
                  and it allowed for a more robust and flexible architecture
                  
                  
                 
My hobby is to produce music.
                 I have honed my skills in recording, editing, and mixing audio tracks,
                 as well as creating beats and loops. I am well-versed in sound design, 
                 I enjoy composing and arranging music in various genres, 
                 and I take great pleasure in experimenting with different sounds and effects,
                 both analog and digital plugins. 
                 I am always looking to collaborate with other producers and to expand my skills.
